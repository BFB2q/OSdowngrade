DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOTHING NEW I HAVE JUST COMPILED ALL THE INFORMATION INTO ONE EASY TO ACCESS THREAD

Before we get started I want to address a few thing:
I have not made/contributed into ANY of the steps/code/methods. All code will be credited to the owner. 

Important Links:
stars-delta.vercel.app This is an exploit/proxy/hack site; if the link is blocked dont worry there are alternative links. Simply join the discord --https://discord.com/invite/zDrJ6cErBC-- and head over to #community-link there will be tons of alternative links.
https://github.com/3kh0/ext-remover this link was used to test the status of extension disablers (all of them are blocked on the latest chrome version (111.0)

Alright let's get into it
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Knowing the latest version of chrome has blocked we have to downgrade

What you need:
A personal Computer 
4GB Hard Drive

1) ON YOUR SCHOOL CHROMEBOOK go to chrome://version and find your board name
for example mine is octopus: "stable-channel-octopus" remember it for later


2) ON YOUR PERSONAL COMPUTER go to https://chrome100.dev/ and find your board name (using ctrl + f is helpful)        
   2a) Click "see more"
   2b) Scroll to board names

3) You want to find any version below 105 (version 81 is highly recommended though)

   3b) to find the version that goes under the chrome label and the whole entire thing before the first "." is the version. For example: for "81.0.4044.141" the version would be 81

4) click download and don't unzip it keep it as a .zip file

5) Download the Chrome Recovery Utility Extension on personal computer (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm)

6) open the extension and click the gear icon and click "Use Local Image" and then select the file you just downloaded and then follow the prompts. After it's done SAFELY eject the USB.

7) On your school Chromebook press "ESC + Refresh + Power" to get to the recovery screen. Plug the USB in and follow the prompts 

8) After you get to the startup and connect the wifi, start spamming "Ctrl + Alt + E '' to ensure you don't auto update. Sign in like you usually do and you'll know if you did it right if you see the enterprise enrollment screen; it looks like a blue bar with a briefcase.

9) after booting up go to chrome://version and make sure it says 81 or the version you selected (below 105 though)

10) If it does, you have done it right! To revert just restart your chromebook. You can keep the USB as is to use again if something goes wrong. NOTE: you can't use the USB as you will have to format it.

Now with downgrading out the way it's time to do the actual extension hack (Luckily this is a simple process)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) go to https://pastebin.com/raw/EugX5nk4 (INGOT) or https://pastebin.com/raw/GfNXgGve (LTBEEF) and copy all the code on the site

2) make a new bookmark and put the code you just copied into it and name it anything

3) go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore_ (if its blocked dm me or message it here) and it should be a 404 page, click on the bookmark you just made 

4) on the site disable any extension you don't want
